Messing with Naoto's example and trying to reverse engineer it for better understanding. what ended up occuring was like watching objects pass on a train. 

As well besides the obvious which is hydra being used to create visualizers for live coded music, it could in a sense be used to elarn about how to create visual effects in p5js. more specifically atleast for our class... water. Or just cool effects as a whole to make the projects have more of a pop alongside having more visual depth.
