Messing with Naoto's example and trying to reverse engineer it for better understanding. what ended up occuring was like watching objects pass on a train.

in this one while i still had sort of a plad pattern, the movement of the color was akin to that of data traveling throuhg cable being visually represented which i thought was interesting as such is sound produced by computers anyway(especially if optical).

As well besides the obvious which is hydra being used to create visualizers for live coded music, it could in a sense be used to elarn about how to create visual effects in p5js. more specifically atleast for our class... water. Or just cool effects as a whole to make the projects have more of a pop alongside having more visual depth.
