##Group Project N Dat 

My focus and contribution to the group project was primarily method of movement for the player alongside the creation of hitboxes and monster array.

Issues our group have faced we cant get the splice(); function to work to remove whatever monster is being collided with as to ahve our ssquirrel eat another and grow. another issue we faced was an issue with collision which may ahve just occrued due to issues with splicing. 

Our vision for the game is you continue to eat smaller squirrels but eventually you get so big you die to the damaging flame due to size only to be reborn again and suffer the same fate.
